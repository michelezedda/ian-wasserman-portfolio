          <p>
            Ian Wasserman is a graduate from the Pennsylvania State University.
            In June of 2020, he began his career as a Spacecraft Thermal
            Engineer for Millennium Space Systems, a Boeing Company. He
            continued his career at Millennium, gaining the title of Lead
            Thermal Engineer after completing a Critical Design Review milestone
            for a multi-vehicle spacecraft program. Branching out from thermal
            engineering, Ian joined the Environmental Test Engineering group. In
            this function, he contributed to qualification and acceptance
            testing of spacecraft hardware, and acted as test director for the
            dynamics campaign for a LEO mission. Ian transitioned back to the
            thermal peer team as an Engineering Manager in 2023, where he
            provides guidance and mentorship to a team of over 15 thermal
            engineers. Ian may be contacted at: ian@ianwass.com.
