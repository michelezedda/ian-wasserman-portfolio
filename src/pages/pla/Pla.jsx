          <h2>PLA: The Presidential Leadership Academy</h2>
          <p>
            The Presidential Leadership Academy (PLA) is a three-year leadership
            and critical thinking program offered to select students at Penn
            State. Students can apply their freshman year, and 30 individuals
            are selected amongst the candidates. The PLA provides opportunities
            such as classes with University leadership, trips across the US, and
            the ability to engage in high-level debate. This page reflects on
            some selected experiences Ian had in the academy.

          <h3>TRIPS</h3>
          <div className="first-row">
            <div className="div1">
              <h4>WASHINGTON D.C.</h4>
              <p>
                My first trip with the PLA was to our nation's capital. Here we
                got to tour the monuments, explore the Holocaust museum, and
                even visit George Washington's estate at Mount Vernon. We also
                got to chat with PLA alumni, including my sister Alyssa
                Sihelnik. I especially liked when we got a private tour of the
                Smithsonian.

            <div className="div2">
              <h4>CHICAGO</h4>
              <p>
                Chicago was a grand adventure of a trip. We learned about some
                of the famous architecture created by Frank Lloyd Wright. We
                also got to tour a waste water treatment plant, which was an
                amazing engineering feat. My favorite part of this trip was our
                visit to the McDonald's headquarters, since I used to work at
                the golden arches for five years!

              <h4>BALTIMORE</h4>
              <p>
                Baltimore was my last fall trip with the PLA. Here we got to
                learn about a second hand store called Second Chance that hires
                people who traditional could not find work due to criminal or
                drug backgrounds. We also got to visit the Baltimore Museum of
                Art. We also went on a boat cruise and watched an air show
                taking place. It was on this cruise that I mentioned to our
                director, Melissa Doberstein, that our next trip should be to
                Los Angeles... and it actually came true! A funny memory from
                this trip was when a couple other PLA members and I went to a
                haunted house inside a Mall outside of the city. It was really
                well done!

            <div className="div4">
              <h4>LOS ANGELES</h4>
              <p>
                LOS ANGELES I may be biased, since I was the one to suggest this
                location, however I stand by my claim that this is the best PLA
                trip. From going up to the Griffith Observatory, to our food
                tour with Six Taste, we all had an amazing time. We got to
                experience both modern and contemporary art through our visits
                to The Broad and The Getty. One of the most interesting parts of
                our trip was the visit to The Ronald Reagan Library, a place
                that I would not have gone to if it weren't for the PLA. Between
                shopping in Beverly Hills with some friends, to perusing the
                boardwalk in Santa Monica, this trip will always have a special
                place in my heart!

            <h3>BLOGS</h3>
            <p>
              A requirement of the PLA is that students must blog about either
              in-class experience (From HONOR 201, 301, or 401 courses), or blog
              about other topics of interest in their busy lives. All of Ian's
              publicly available blogs can be viewed HERE, however select
              favorites are described below:

              How have I grown, and how has the academy impacted me?

              <p>
                Over the three-year period that I participated in the PLA, I
                could recognize many impactful changes in my perception and
                skillset. I gained an appreciation for exploring cultures and
                cities that went beyond the surface. I also learned how to
                effectively communicate my ideas and beliefs, while also being
                open to other individual's viewpoints. The PLA has also taught
                me the importance of building meaningful connections, as well as
                the power of good mentorship.

              How would I describe my leadership style? Has it changed since
              when I applied to the academy? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            {dropdownStates[1] && (
              <p>
                I would describe me leadership style as decisive and thoughtful.
                I find myself weighing the consequences, good and bad, of any
                decision I make that impacts others. However, I also understand
                the importance of following through with decisions that have
                been made. Some additions to my leadership characteristics that
                have changed because of my involvement with the academy include
                bringing the best out of the people at my disposal, and
                welcoming diverse inputs in the idea-creation process. I would
                also say that the PLA highlighted the importance of building
                empathy into one's demeanor, as the world can always use more of
                this!

              What are some recommended changes or additions to the PLA for

              <p>
                Honestly, there is not much more to add. I believe the PLA is
                one of the shining examples of the best programs Penn State has
                to offer students. If I had to suggest one thing, I would say
                that Honor 401 classes should always be based around a theme or
                group of related themes, not just about leadership in general. I
                enjoyed the class that explored Abraham Lincoln's presidency,
                and I think having a focused topic allows the class to feel
                organic and less disjointed at times.
