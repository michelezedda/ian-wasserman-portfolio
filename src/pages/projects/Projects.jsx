              <h3>CHEMICAL-LOOPING COMBUSTION</h3>
              <h4>WASTE RESOURCE RECOVERY RESEARCH</h4>
              <p>
                Spring 2018 to Spring 2020 - As a part of the requirements for
                graduation in the Energy and Mineral Engineering master's
                program, Ian conducted research under the guidance of Dr. Sarma
                Pisupati. He focused on how petroleum coke ash, a waste product
                of the fossil fuel industry, can be reformatted and used as an
                oxygen carrier in chemical-looping combustion (CLC). CLC
                provides the benefits of creating a virtually 100% capture and
                sequestration-ready supply of CO2. By combining the research
                areas of advanced combustion and waste resource recovery, Ian
                hopes to pave the way for future sustainable power generation.

              <h3>EUROPA CLIPPER SPACECRAFT</h3>
              <h4>THERMAL ENGINEERING INTERNSHIP</h4>
              <p>
                Summer 2019 - Following his junior year, Ian returned to the
                NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for a second internship. At
                JPL, he worked with the thermal engineering team for the Europa
                Clipper spacecraft. He was responsible for overseeing the tests
                of newly constructed thin film heaters that were to be installed
                at various points on the spacecraft. Utilizing advanced thermal
                modeling software, as well as performing watt density tests in a
                vacuum chamber, Ian established maximum power limits for the
                heaters which helped to guide the design principle used for the
                mission. He also got to work under Jenny Hua, who is an amazing
                mentor!

              <h3>SHELL ECO-MARATHON</h3>
              <h4>URBAN CONCEPT VEHICLE CAPSTONE</h4>
              <p>
                Spring 2019 - As a part of his senior design project, Ian
                participated on the Shell Eco-Marathon Urban Concept Vehicle
                team at Penn State. Working on the powertrain team, Ian's
                specific responsibilities included: managing the fuel system,
                assisting with welding and manufacturing of critical components,
                and creating the vehicle's exhaust subsystem. The Eco-marathon
                team completed their vehicle in a nine week timespan, and
                successfully competed with it at the Sonoma Raceway in
                California. The vehicle achieved a fuel efficiency of 238.1 mpg,
                and did not crash once! Ian believes this was the best team
                project he ever got to work on at Penn State.

              <h3>ENCELADUS CONCEPT MISSION</h3>
              <h4>SYSTEMS ENGINEERING INTERNSHIP</h4>
              <p>
                Summer 2018 - After his sophomore year, Ian received his first
                summer internship with the Systems Engineering division at the
                NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). There, he was placed on a
                discovery-class mission concept team, working on a proposal for
                a spacecraft destined to explore Enceladus, an icy moon of
                Saturn. At JPL, Ian got to know Shaun Standley, who was his
                mentor for the 10-week-long internship. Although the proposal
                was cut a few weeks after Ian returned to Penn State, the
                fantastic experience and newly obtained skills allowed Ian to
                pursue a second internship at JPL for the following summer.
